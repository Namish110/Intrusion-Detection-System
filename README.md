# Intrusion-Detection-System

Developed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging a robust ensemble of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Network, and Decision Tree.

Implemented Random Forest for its high accuracy and resilience against overfitting, KNN for efficient anomaly detection based on proximity, Neural Network for complex pattern recognition, and Decision Tree for transparent 

rule-based analysis.

This comprehensive IDS enhances cybersecurity by detecting and classifying suspicious network activities, ensuring timely responses to potential threats.

The ensemble approach amalgamates the strengths of each algorithm, providing a resilient and adaptive defense mechanism against a diverse range of intrusions.

The system's effectiveness is underpinned by continuous training on evolving datasets, reflecting a commitment to staying ahead of emerging cybersecurity challenges.
